NumPy) you wish to explain your answers.

EXERCISE 2.1

import pandas and read the csv-file found in Moodle (loans.csv). Use 
Python coding with pandas to answer the questions.

Are there any outliers in the data that might affect the averages 
negatively (certain salaries)? Manage the outliers as you best see 
fit (either remove them or leave them, based on your analysis
     
     o If we want to correlate upon categories (ordinal or binary), we 
       need to use factorize(). Factorize the Role-column, and add the 
       new column to the DataFrame.
     o Note: using factorize() for nominal categories (Job Title, 
       Location, Company Name) doesn't work well, because the 
       numbers do not have any numeric magnitude. In other 
       words, these categories don't measure anything, they just 
       group data, so numerical comparison / correlation doesn't 
       mean anything statistically.

# example:
# factorize Role level into numbers
label1, unique1 = pd.factorize(df['Role'], sort=False)
df['ManagerRole'] = label1

    Going over the salaries, and it seems that under 30000 and over 30000000
